12/Mar/05  Huge changes, major items are:

1. The original plug_in and autoload system (see 5/Sep/04 below)
   has been completely revamped to make a true "package" system.
   Read the final chapter of doc/yorick.pdf for details.  The
   bottom line is that #include on a .i file which declares the
   interface to a plugin (dynamically linked compiled code) now
   makes the compiled functions available in such a way that the
   end user doesn't even need to know it was compiled and not
   interpreted.  The autoload function means that most packages
   need no explicit #include in order to use them; #include now
   is used almost exclusively for code you are actively developing.

2. The Makefile system for compiled yorick add-ons has completely
   changed.  This will require reworking both your Makefiles and
   the .i file(s) which declare the compiled functions to be changed.
   Read the completely new final section in the manual (doc/yorick.pdf).
   Short story:
   a. Add a plug_in command (help,plug_in) to the top of any .i
      file which declares a compiled (builtin) function, and remove
      any MAKE-INSTRUCTIONS comment.
   b. Rename your Makefile to Makefile.sav, then run
        yorick -batch make.i
      This makes a good first cut at the new Makefile.  Merge anything
      the new make.i missed (including any PKG_DEPLIBS) back from
      your original Makefile.sav into the new Makefile.
   Look in the drat, hex, or mpy directories for examples of the
   new style of package Makefile.  You can practice in the extend/
   subdirectory.  Get the yorick-z-1.0 package for an example of
   a compiled package which is not part of this distribution.

3. The string manipulation functions have been dramatically extended.
   New functions include strgrep, strglob, strfind, streplace,
   strcase, a new string-to-char-to-string converter strchar, and
   a powerfully extended strpart.  Do help,string for details.

4. The yorick user manual and quick reference cards have been updated.
   Several new features have been added to the i/ interpreted library,
   such as Poisson deviates in random.i, and IEEE 754 support in ieee.i.
   Also a pdf command has been added as a companion to the eps and hcps
   commands, which may enable Mac and Windows users to more easily
   import yorick graphics into PowerPoint (TM).

version 1.5.02

Mostly for Build-Depends fix to debian package.  Minor fixes to

problems.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

02/may/01 version 1.5.01

First release of yorick-1.5.  The directory structure and
configuration scripts have completely changed; see the top-level
README for more.  The 1.5 version of yorick has the directory
structure, configuration scripts, and portability layer for
yorick-2.0, but still has the 1.4 interpreter.  The MacOS portion of
the portability layer is not yet present, but the Windows portion is
complete or nearly complete.

There are a few new features:

1. RGB colors supported for color= keyword, pli, plf, plfp
   see help,color or help,pli for more information

2. lsdir, mkdir, rmdir functions added so yorick can read and
   manipulate directories by itself

3. i86_primitives and other modern binary formats added
   see help,createb and help,__i86 for more information

4. cheby.i, convol.i, dawson.i, kepler.i added to interpreted
   library

5. added "hex" 3D transport solver (similar to drat 2D solver)

6. improved the emacs/yorick.el package again, mostly by removing
   unwanted "improvements" to emacs; see emacs/README

The yorick homepage and Web-based documentation has also been
completely reworked.  Visit

   ftp://ftp-icf.llnl.gov/pub/Yorick/

or the new homepage

   ftp://ftp-icf.llnl.gov/pub/Yorick/doc/index.html

You can download all this Web-based documentation (and the yorick and
texi2html scripts used to create it) from the downloads page there.
It is based on the work of Robert Cannon, who deserves most of the
credit but none of the blame for the new look.  Perhaps his best idea
is the HTML-ized source code for the entire interpreted library, which
makes it much easier to study the interpreted source code that comes
with the yorick distribution.  Ferdinand Jamitzky also helped by
making a first cut at converting the Quick Reference Cards to HTML; it
now works pretty much as well as the PDF or printed versions.
