This directory contains a set of more matrix functions for yorick,
obtained from lapack, which is available at netlib.org.

(1) Tridiagonal solver.

(2) LU decomposition (by Gaussian elimination) matrix solver

(3) QR decomposition matrix solver

(4) SVD matrix solver and analyzer

The file startup/matrix.i describes the interpreted interface.

I converted the original Fortran source to C using my f2c.el Emacs
functions (Emacs 19.25, but should work with others) and a few by-hand
fixes afterwards.  The "by hand fixes" included several typographical
bugs introduced by f2c.el --- so beware.  For these few routines, I
prefer this nearly-by-hand translation to the illegible machine C
translation available as clapack.  This is still far from ideal,
however, since many of the branches can never be accessed, and should
therefore be removed from this source.  I may also have introduced
bugs in the translation process, especially in the unused branches.

The blas routines (cblasy.c) have the same interface as the C blas
standard, so if you have a fast blas C library, you should be able to
use it instead of the cblasy.c supplied here.
