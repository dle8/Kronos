This directory contains the Swarztrauber FFT routines.

They came from fftpack, available at netlib.org.  The file
startup/fft.i describes the interpreted interface.

I converted the original Fortran source to C using my f2c.el Emacs
functions (Emacs 19.25, but should work with others) and a few by-hand
fixes afterwards.  The "by hand fixes" included several typographical
bugs introduced by f2c.el --- so beware.
