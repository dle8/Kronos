There is an OpenGL package for yorick written by Steve Langer at
llnl.gov.  This package, yorgl, will be released as yorick-gl.  The
files in this directory are examples of how OpenGL can be detected and
inserted into the play/x11 or play/win windowing functions.  They are
probably out of date with respect to yorick-gl, and this directory
will be deleted when yorgl source archiving makes it superfluous.
