Yorick is an interpreted programming language for:
 * scientific simulations or calculations
 * postprocessing or steering large simulation codes
 * interactive scientific graphics
 * reading, writing, and translating large files of numbers

The language features a compact syntax for many common array
operations, so it processes large arrays of numbers very quickly and
efficiently.  Superficially, yorick code resembles C code, but yorick
variables are never explicitly declared and have a dynamic scoping
similar to many Lisp dialects.  The yorick language is designed to be
typed interactively at a keyboard, as well as stored in files for
later use.

This package includes an emacs-based development environment, which
you can launch by typing M-x yorick in emacs, if you load
.../share/yorick/yorick.el in your ~/.emacs file.
