These interpreted source files are read by yorick as it starts.  (The
actual commands which include them may be found in i0/stdx.i.)

All files in this directory whose names end with ".i" will be
included, in alphabetical order (all uppercase letters precede any
lower case letter, and digits precede either).  Other files (such as
this README) are ignored.

There are a total of three i-start directories which treated the same
way at startup.  All of the .i files in these directories are included
automatically whenever yorick starts, in this order:

  Y_SITE/i-start
  Y_HOME/i-start      (skipped if Y_HOME == Y_SITE)
  ~/yorick/i-start    (or ~/Yorick/i-start)

Mostly, these startup files should contain autoload commands to load
other .i files at first reference to the API functions defined
therein.  Yorick packages can install themselves by simply placing a
file in one of these directories, possibly along with files in
Y_SITE/i and/or Y_HOME/lib, or in ~/yorick.  The Y_SITE/i-start
directory is intended for packages which contain only interpreted
code.  The Y_HOME/i-start directory is for plugins (see the plug_in
function), and the ~/yorick/i-start directory is for user-written
packages.

50i.i   autoloads for most frequently used library functions in
        the i/ directory
        - this name is selected to make it easy to implement a
          "/etc/rc.d"-style ordering of package includes, with
          filenames beginning with two digits
