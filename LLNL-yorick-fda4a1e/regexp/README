This directory contains the regexp and fnmatch routines.

Guido van Rossum wrote the fnmatch routines, and contributed them to
the University of California for the BSD operating system.  The name
has been changed by appending _fr (for Francois Rigaut) in order to
avoid collision with the libc routine.  The original source is
available from any BSD website, or from Apple's Darwin sources:

http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/lib/libc/gen/fnmatch.c

Henry Spencer wrote the regexp routines for the University of Toronto.
The source code has been (slightly) modified from the original in
order to link it into yorick.  The original source is available at:
